What
====

This is the source code for the [Cedro Peak Ultramarathon site](http://cpu45.org).

Currently the entire web site is just a few static pages.  However, the site will become a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) 3.1 web site with features for runners, the race director and volunteers.

Who
===

It's being built by [RubiABQ](http://www.meetup.com/Rubyists-in-Albuquerque/), the Albuquerque Ruby Users Group.  We're planning on dragooning some of the members of [Cocoa Conspiracy](http://cocoaconspiracy.com/) to create some fun iPhone and iPad tools that will interact with the database that drives this site.

Why
===

Everyone needs a hobby.  Writing Rails apps and Ruby code is fun.  Our Ruby group wanted a joint project and this is one of them.

When
====

[RubiABQ](http://www.meetup.com/Rubyists-in-Albuquerque/) meets twice a month, on the second and fourth Tuesday.  Sometimes we work on this project there.  Other times, people hack on it at home and discuss their changes (or forget to) at the next meeting.

Currently there is no timeline, but now that [registration](http://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=13576) is open for CPU45, we really need to get some momentum.

Where
=====
The [RubiABQ](http://www.meetup.com/Rubyists-in-Albuquerque/) meetings are typically at [One-Up](http://www.oneupabq.com/), where they provide us with a room with a nice flatscreen display.


How
===
If you'd like to contribute, we'll find a way for you to.  If you need some time to come up to speed, that's fine, too.  If you'd like, we can give you some pointers or even lend you some books.

If you're already well versed in Rails and GitHub, send us your pull requests, please!
