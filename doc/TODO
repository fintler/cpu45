        convert our static HTML to HAML

        share the navigation instead of having it replicated (it's already
        diverged!)

========================================================================

        Mass Assignment issues in admin/users (tests succeed, but
        running the code doesn't)

========================================================================

        Make it so that autotest-fsevent and autotest-growl aren't needed
        where they don't exist

        admin/users Fix the birthday label

        Make the time-zone be a pull-down

        validate the time-zone

        use formtastic for the forms

        Document what is necessary to get the database working (or
        perhaps create a script)

        How about using asset pipeline
        <http://railscasts.com/episodes/282-upgrading-to-rails-3-1>
        but that would require moving from static to dynamic content

        Finish setting up devise:

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here 
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment 
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to => "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. If you are deploying Rails 3.1 on Heroku, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.
