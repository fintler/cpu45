        seed data for myself, kim and Jim?

        Mass Assignment issues in admin/users (tests succeed, but
        running the code doesn't)

        Make it so that autotest-fsevent and autotest-growl aren't needed
        where they don't exist

        admin/users Fix the birthday label

        Finish setting up devise:

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here 
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment 
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. DONE

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
