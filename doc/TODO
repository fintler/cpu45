DONE    Add non-null constraints to the user migration

        Fix errors!

        Make it so that autotest-fsevent and autotest-growl aren't needed
        where they don't exist

        Add validations to the user model

                use new syntax

        attr_accessible for everyone -- can I do it at the base level and
        have it inherited?

        Move some of the current user stuff into admin

        Fix the birthday label

        Make the time-zone be a pull-down

        use formtastic for the forms

        Document what is necessary to get the database working (or
        perhaps create a script)

        Set up devise

        How about using asset pipeline
        <http://railscasts.com/episodes/282-upgrading-to-rails-3-1>
        but that would require moving from static to dynamic content
