This is a web-site for the Cedro Peak Ultra 45, an ultramarathon just
south of Albuquerque.

This site serves many purposes.  It will provide entrants with basic
information about the ultra.  It will also provide organizers with some
tools to help the race run smoother.  It is also being developed by members
of RubiABQ, the Albuquerque Ruby Users' group.  You can find out more
about RubiABQ via <http://www.meetup.com/Rubyists-in-Albuquerque/>.
